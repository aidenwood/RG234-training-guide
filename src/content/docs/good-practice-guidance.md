# Good Practice Guidance

## Core Advertising Principles

### 🎯 Returns, Features, Benefits and Risks

#### ✅ Best Practices
- **Balanced messaging**: Benefits should not be given undue prominence compared with risks
- **Realistic expectations**: Don't overstate potential benefits or create unrealistic expectations
- **Clear explanations**: Include assumptions made in predicting benefits
- **Risk disclosure**: Information about risks should be clear, prominent, and not undermined by tone

#### ❌ Avoid These Pitfalls
- Promoting high-risk strategies without adequate risk disclosure
- Making claims that rely on past performance continuing indefinitely
- Overstating product safety (very few products are fully guaranteed)
- Creating misleading impressions about complex products

### 🚨 Warnings, Disclaimers & Qualifications

#### ✅ Effective Warnings
- **Prominent placement**: Must effectively convey key information on first viewing
- **Consistent messaging**: Cannot contradict headline claims
- **Same format**: Warnings should be in similar form to main advertisement
- **Immediate disclosure**: Must be published at same time as original message

#### ❌ Common Mistakes
- Relying on references to other websites or documents to correct misleading impressions
- Using fine print that's hard to read or understand
- Creating headline claims so strong that qualifications can't correct them
- Publishing qualifications separately from main message

### 💰 Fees and Costs

#### ✅ Clear Fee Disclosure
- Give realistic impression of **overall** level of fees and costs
- Include indirect fees and costs where relevant
- For returns: should be net of fees to greatest extent practicable
- Clearly state if other costs apply beyond advertised fees

#### ❌ Misleading Fee Claims
- Claiming "no fees" when fees exist but are waived under certain conditions
- Advertising "one low fee" while other costs apply
- Promoting attractive features without disclosing fees to access them
- Using "free" when any charges apply to use the product

### 📊 Comparisons

#### ✅ Valid Comparisons
- Only compare products with **sufficiently similar features**
- Use current, complete, and accurate information
- Clearly explain rating systems and their meaning
- Disclose if not all market options are included

#### ❌ Invalid Comparisons
- Comparing high-risk products (e.g., debentures) with low-risk products (e.g., bank deposits)
- Ignoring key features like excess amounts in insurance
- Using outdated or selective comparison data
- Misleading use of terms like "high" or "low" without proper context

### 📈 Past Performance and Forecasts

#### ✅ Responsible Use
- **Past performance**: Must include warning that past performance is not indicative of future performance
- **Forecasts**: Must be based on reasonable assumptions and state they're not guaranteed
- Include detailed guidance from RG 53 for performance information

#### ❌ Misleading Practices
- Implying past performance will continue
- Making forecasts without reasonable grounds
- Focusing solely on past performance for investment decisions

### 🗣️ Use of Terms and Phrases

#### ✅ Appropriate Usage
- Use terms consistently with ordinary consumer understanding
- Avoid industry jargon unless confident audience understands
- Be careful with strong terms like "guaranteed," "secure," "free"
- Comply with restricted terminology requirements

#### ❌ Problematic Terms
- Using "independent" when receiving commissions
- Describing complex products as "simple" or "stress-free"
- Using "guaranteed" without proper qualifications
- Industry jargon that misleads consumers

## Target Audience Considerations

### 👥 Audience Assessment
- Consider **actual** audience characteristics (financial literacy, demographics)
- Ensure advertisements are capable of being understood by intended audience
- Don't state product suitability without proper assessment
- Complex products shouldn't target wider audiences than appropriate

### 🎯 Responsible Targeting
- Advertisements shouldn't imply suitability for groups without assessment
- Consider distribution channels and their typical audiences
- Ensure complexity matches audience sophistication
- Avoid targeting vulnerable consumers with inappropriate products

## Product-Specific Requirements

### 🏠 Credit Products
- **Interest rates**: Must include comparison rates where required
- **Responsible lending**: Don't imply guaranteed acceptance
- **Realistic costs**: Include all relevant fees and charges
- **Terms accuracy**: Ensure promotional periods are clearly explained

### 💼 Financial Advice Services
- **Scope clarity**: Don't overstate breadth of services offered
- **Independence claims**: Only if genuinely independent
- **Realistic expectations**: About what service can achieve
- **Fee disclosure**: Must be clear about all costs involved

### 📱 Digital and Social Media
- **Banner ads**: Consider overall impression when viewed alone
- **Social media**: Character limits don't excuse misleading content
- **Interactive content**: Additional information can't cure misleading headlines
- **Record keeping**: Ensure advertisements can be preserved

## Consistency Requirements

### 📋 Disclosure Document Alignment
- Advertisements must be consistent with PDSs, prospectuses, contracts
- Can't contradict key terms or conditions
- Must account for prescribed disclosures
- Include required references to disclosure documents

### 🔄 Ongoing Accuracy
- Regularly review advertisements for continued accuracy
- Withdraw outdated advertisements promptly
- Consider market changes that might affect claims
- Update for legislative or regulatory changes
