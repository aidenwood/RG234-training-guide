### 🔍 What Constitutes Misleading/Deceptive Conduct

An advertisement may be misleading or deceptive if it:
- Creates false expectations about product features
- Overstates benefits while understating risks
- Uses terms inconsistently with their ordinary meaning
- Omits important information that consumers would reasonably expect
- Contains qualifications that don't adequately balance headline claims

## Core Principles

### 🎯 Balance is Key
Advertisements should provide balanced information so consumers can understand the nature of the product or service being advertised.

### 👥 Consider Your Audience
- The **actual audience** that sees the advertisement (not just your target audience)
- Their level of financial literacy and understanding
- Whether the advertisement is appropriate for that audience

### 📝 First Impression Matters
- Consumers cannot be expected to study or revisit advertisements
- The overall impression created on first viewing is most important
- Qualifications must be clear and prominent

### 🚫 No "Cure" for Misleading Ads
If an advertisement is misleading, it cannot be corrected by:
- Accurate disclosure documents
- Fine print
- References to other documents
- Subsequent clarifications

## Industry Expectations
