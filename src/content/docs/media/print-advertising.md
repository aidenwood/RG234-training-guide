#### 📊 Print Context
- **Engaged readership**: Print readers often more focused and engaged
- **Trust factor**: Print media maintains high credibility and trust
- **Longer shelf life**: Magazines and newspapers kept and shared
- **Professional context**: Business publications reach decision-makers

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Fine Print Overuse
- **Problem**: Making disclaimers so small they're unreadable
- **Solution**: Integrate key warnings into main copy
- **Standard**: If average reader can't read it, it doesn't meet requirements

#### ❌ Misleading Visual Elements
- **Problem**: Charts, graphs, or images that contradict disclaimers
- **Solution**: Ensure all visual elements support balanced messaging
- **Example**: Avoid upward arrows while discussing investment risks

#### ❌ Inconsistent Advertorial Labeling
- **Problem**: Paid content not clearly distinguished from editorial
- **Solution**: Clear "Advertisement" or "Sponsored Content" labeling
- **Placement**: Label must be prominent and unambiguous
