# Events & Presentations Guidelines

## 🎪 Event Marketing Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Event Challenges
- **Live interaction**: Real-time compliance delivery requirements
- **Audience questions**: Unpredictable inquiry management
- **Presentation flow**: Balancing engagement with comprehensive disclosure
- **Follow-up obligations**: Post-event communication compliance

#### 📊 Event Context
- **Engaged audience**: Attendees actively seeking information
- **Professional environment**: Business networking and education focus
- **Trust building**: Face-to-face credibility establishment
- **Immediate feedback**: Real-time audience response and questions

### ✅ Best Practices for Marketing Teams

#### 🎤 Presentation Structure and Compliance

##### Educational Seminar Format
```
SEMINAR STRUCTURE:
✓ Clear educational purpose statement
✓ Speaker credentials and licensing disclosure
✓ Balanced information presentation
✓ Risk warnings integrated throughout
✓ Question handling protocols

EXAMPLE RETIREMENT SEMINAR:
Opening: "This is an educational presentation. Any information provided 
is general in nature and doesn't consider your personal circumstances."
Content: Balanced discussion of retirement planning strategies
Disclaimers: Integrated throughout, not just at end
Product mention: "If we discuss specific products, I'll provide PDSs"
Closing: "For personal advice, please arrange individual consultation"
```

##### Product Launch Events
```
LAUNCH EVENT COMPLIANCE:
✓ Product benefits with corresponding risks
✓ Comprehensive disclosure materials available
✓ Licensed presenter requirements
✓ Attendee information capture protocols
✓ Follow-up communication compliance

PRESENTATION FLOW:
Introduction: Company and presenter credentials
Product overview: Balanced benefit and risk presentation
Q&A session: Prepared responses for common questions
Materials: PDS distribution and explanation
Next steps: Individual consultation offering
```

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Inadequate Speaker Training
- **Problem**: Presenters not adequately trained on compliance requirements
- **Solution**: Comprehensive speaker briefing and regular training updates
- **Preparation**: Scripts and Q&A preparation for compliance scenarios

#### ❌ Pressure Sales Environment
- **Problem**: Creating urgency that prevents careful consideration
- **Solution**: Educational focus with clear cooling-off period communication
- **Approach**: Information provision rather than sales pressure

### 📋 Content Requirements by Product Type

#### 💰 Investment Product Events
```
INVESTMENT EVENT ESSENTIALS:
✓ Past performance context and warnings
✓ Investment risk acknowledgments throughout
✓ PDS availability and explanation
✓ Market condition context
✓ Professional advice recommendations

EXAMPLE INVESTMENT PRESENTATION:
"Our Balanced Fund returned 8% last year, but it's crucial to understand 
that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Let me show you 
the range of returns over different time periods, including years when 
the fund lost money. Investment markets are unpredictable, and your 
investment value will rise and fall over time."
```

#### 🏠 Credit Product Events
```
CREDIT EVENT REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Interest rates with comparison rates
✓ Assessment process transparency
✓ Credit criteria explanation
✓ Individual circumstances emphasis
✓ Australian Credit Licence display

EXAMPLE MORTGAGE SEMINAR:
"Current home loan rates start from 4.5% with a 4.8% comparison rate 
based on $150,000 over 25 years. However, your actual rate depends on 
our assessment of your individual circumstances. Credit criteria apply, 
and we need to ensure any loan is suitable for your situation."
```
