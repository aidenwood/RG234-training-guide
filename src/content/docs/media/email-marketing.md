# Email Marketing Guidelines

## 📧 Email-Specific Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Email Marketing Challenges
- **Direct communication**: Personal inbox creates higher trust and scrutiny expectations
- **Spam regulations**: Must comply with anti-spam laws alongside financial regulations
- **Segmentation complexity**: Different audiences require different compliance approaches
- **Forward/share risk**: Content may be shared beyond intended recipient

#### 📊 Audience Context
- **Permission-based**: Recipients have opted in, indicating interest
- **Personal device viewing**: Often read on mobile phones in private settings
- **High attention potential**: Email allows longer-form content than many media
- **Action-oriented**: Recipients expect clear next steps and information

### ✅ Best Practices for Marketing Teams

#### 📮 Email Campaign Strategy

##### Permission and Consent Management
```
OPT-IN REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Clear consent for financial product marketing
✓ Explicit permission for different product types
✓ Easy unsubscribe mechanisms
✓ Preference management options
✓ Regular consent reconfirmation

CONSENT EXAMPLES:
"Yes, I'd like to receive investment opportunity updates from ABC Investments"
"Send me home loan rate alerts and mortgage information"
"Keep me informed about insurance products and claim tips"
```

##### Segmentation and Targeting
```
COMPLIANCE-BASED SEGMENTATION:
✓ Investment experience level
✓ Product ownership status
✓ Age and life stage appropriateness
✓ Geographic location
✓ Consent preferences

SEGMENTATION EXAMPLES:
• Existing customers: Product updates, portfolio information
• Prospects: Educational content, introductory offers
• High-net-worth: Sophisticated investment opportunities
• First-time buyers: Basic products, educational content
```

#### 📝 Email Content Structure

##### Header and Subject Line Compliance
```
SUBJECT LINE REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Accurate representation of content
✓ No misleading claims or promises
✓ Clear company identification
✓ Avoid spam trigger words
✓ Appropriate urgency language

SUBJECT LINE EXAMPLES:
Good: "ABC Super Quarterly Update - Your Portfolio Performance"
Good: "New Home Loan Rates from ABC Bank - 4.5% p.a."
Avoid: "GUARANTEED 10% RETURNS - ACT NOW!"
Avoid: "Risk-Free Investment Opportunity Inside"
```

##### Email Body Structure
```
OPTIMAL EMAIL LAYOUT:
1. Clear sender identification and branding
2. Personalized greeting (where appropriate)
3. Main content with balanced messaging
4. Risk warnings and disclaimers
5. Call-to-action with compliance links
6. Footer with complete company information
7. Unsubscribe and preference management
```

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Inadequate Disclaimer Placement
- **Problem**: Putting all compliance information in fine print at bottom
- **Solution**: Integrate warnings throughout content, prominent placement
- **Standard**: Key risks should appear near related benefits

#### ❌ Misleading Subject Lines
- **Problem**: Subject promising more than email or landing page delivers
- **Solution**: Subject line must accurately reflect email content
- **Test**: Subject line should set appropriate expectations

#### ❌ Ignoring Anti-Spam Laws
- **Problem**: Focusing only on financial regulations, ignoring email regulations
- **Solution**: Comply with both Spam Act and RG234 requirements
- **Integration**: Both sets of requirements must be met simultaneously

### 📋 Content Requirements by Product Type

#### 💰 Investment Product Emails
```
INVESTMENT EMAIL ESSENTIALS:
✓ Past performance disclaimers (if applicable)
✓ Investment risk acknowledgments
✓ PDS availability and links
✓ Fee information transparency
✓ Company licensing details

EXAMPLE INVESTMENT NEWSLETTER:
Subject: "ABC Balanced Fund - September Quarter Update"

Header: ABC Investments AFSL 123456

Dear [Name],

Your ABC Balanced Fund returned 2.1% this quarter, bringing the

performance. Investment values can rise and fall, and you may receive 
back less than you invested.
