# Television Advertising Guidelines

## 📺 Television-Specific Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Television Challenges
- **Visual and audio elements**: Must coordinate both channels effectively
- **Time constraints**: Limited seconds to convey benefits and risks
- **Passive viewing**: Audience may be distracted or channel surfing
- **Regulatory scrutiny**: High-profile medium attracts regulatory attention

#### 📊 Audience Context
- **Mass audience**: Wide demographic spread with varying financial sophistication
- **Living room environment**: Family viewing, children may be present
- **Prime time costs**: Expensive slots demand maximum effectiveness
- **DVR and streaming**: Some ads may be skipped or fast-forwarded

### ✅ Best Practices for Marketing Teams

#### 🎬 Visual and Audio Integration

##### Text Disclosure Requirements
```
VISUAL DISCLAIMER STANDARDS:
✓ Readable font size and contrast
✓ Sufficient display duration
✓ No competing visual elements
✓ Clear, simple language
✓ Synchronized with audio disclosure

TIMING GUIDELINES:
• 15-second ad: 4 seconds minimum for disclaimers
• 30-second ad: 6-8 seconds for disclaimers  
• 60-second ad: 10-12 seconds for disclaimers
```

##### Audio Disclosure Standards
```
VOICEOVER REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Normal conversational pace
✓ Clear pronunciation and diction
✓ Appropriate volume level
✓ No background music interference
✓ Professional, serious tone for risks
```

#### 📝 Script and Storyboard Development

##### Structure Framework
```
OPTIMAL AD STRUCTURE:
0-5 seconds: Hook/attention grabber
5-20 seconds: Main product benefits
20-26 seconds: Risk disclosures
26-30 seconds: Call to action

VISUAL FLOW:
Opening: Engaging product/lifestyle imagery
Middle: Product demonstration/explanation
Disclosure: Clean, focused text screens
Closing: Branding and contact information
```

##### Example Scripts by Length

**30-Second Investment Product Ad:**
```
VISUAL: Professional looking at tablet with portfolio data
AUDIO: "Take control of your retirement with XYZ Super."

VISUAL: Graph showing growth over time
AUDIO: "Our balanced fund returned 8% last year."

VISUAL: Clear text screen with disclaimer
AUDIO: "Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. 
Investment values can fall as well as rise."

VISUAL: Company logo and website
AUDIO: "Read our PDS before deciding. XYZ Super, AFSL 123456."
```

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Rushing Disclaimers
- **Problem**: Speaking rapidly through legal requirements
- **Solution**: Allocate adequate time, speak at normal pace
- **Test**: If voice talent can't read comfortably, it's too fast

#### ❌ Visual Distraction During Disclaimers
- **Problem**: Exciting visuals while delivering risk warnings
- **Solution**: Simple, clean screens during important disclosures
- **Focus**: Make disclaimer the primary visual element

#### ❌ Inappropriate Emotional Tone
- **Problem**: Upbeat music continuing during serious warnings
- **Solution**: Adjust music and tone for disclosure sections
- **Balance**: Maintain engagement while showing respect for risks
