# Outdoor & Billboard Guidelines

## 🏗️ Outdoor Advertising Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Outdoor Challenges
- **Viewing time**: 3-5 seconds maximum exposure time
- **Distance viewing**: Must be readable from significant distances
- **Weather impact**: Visibility affected by environmental conditions
- **Mass exposure**: Seen by diverse, uncontrolled audience

#### 📊 Outdoor Context
- **Commuter audience**: Often viewed during travel
- **Local targeting**: Geographic precision opportunities
- **High visibility**: Prominent, unavoidable placement
- **Brand building**: Strong awareness and recall potential

### ✅ Best Practices for Marketing Teams

#### 🏗️ Billboard Size and Format Strategy

##### Large Format Billboards
```
BILLBOARD COMPLIANCE ESSENTIALS:
✓ Maximum 7 words for instant readability
✓ High contrast colors for visibility
✓ Simple, bold typography
✓ Essential disclaimer only
✓ Clear company identification

EXAMPLE INVESTMENT BILLBOARD:
Main text: "SUPER GROWTH FUND"
Subtext: "8% RETURN LAST YEAR*"
Disclaimer: "*PAST PERFORMANCE WARNING - SEE WEBSITE"
Brand: "ABC INVESTMENTS AFSL 123456"
Website: "ABC-INVESTMENTS.COM.AU"
```

##### Transit Advertising
```
BUS/TRAIN AD CONSIDERATIONS:
✓ Captive audience - longer viewing time
✓ Demographic targeting by route
✓ Mobile-friendly website references

```

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Information Overload
- **Problem**: Trying to include too much text for viewing time
- **Solution**: Single clear message with website for details
- **Rule**: If you can't read it in 3 seconds, it's too complex

#### ❌ Inadequate Contrast
- **Problem**: Poor visibility in various lighting conditions
- **Solution**: High contrast colors, bold typography
- **Testing**: Verify readability at actual viewing distances
