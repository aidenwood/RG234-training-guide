# Online Video & YouTube Guidelines

## 🎥 Online Video-Specific Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Online Video Challenges
- **Viewer control**: Ability to pause, rewind, skip, and share content
- **Global accessibility**: Content visible worldwide with local compliance needs
- **Algorithm dependence**: Platform algorithms affect content discovery and targeting
- **Comment interactions**: User-generated responses require monitoring

#### 📊 Audience Context
- **Active engagement**: Viewers choose to watch, higher attention levels
- **Mobile-first**: Majority viewing on mobile devices
- **Sound variations**: May watch with/without sound, captions important
- **Sharing potential**: Content can be shared, extending reach unpredictably

### ✅ Best Practices for Marketing Teams

#### 🎬 Video Content Strategy

##### YouTube-Specific Formats
```
CONTENT TYPE OPTIONS:
✓ Pre-roll ads (5-20 seconds, skippable after 5s)
✓ Mid-roll ads (inserted during longer content)
✓ Sponsored content (full videos featuring products)
✓ Company channel content (owned content strategy)
✓ Influencer collaborations (third-party endorsements)
```

##### Mobile-First Design Principles
```
MOBILE OPTIMIZATION:
✓ Large, readable text (minimum 22pt font)
✓ High contrast for small screen viewing
✓ Key information in first 5 seconds
✓ Vertical and square format options
✓ Subtitle/caption integration
✓ Touch-friendly interactive elements
```

#### 📝 Script Development for Online Video

##### Short-Form Ads (5-30 seconds)
```
STRUCTURE FOR SHORT ADS:
0-3 seconds: Hook (must grab attention before skip)
3-15 seconds: Key benefit or value proposition
15-25 seconds: Risk disclosure and compliance
25-30 seconds: Clear call to action

EXAMPLE 15-SECOND INVESTMENT AD:
"Growing your super? XYZ returned 8% last year. Past performance doesn't 
guarantee future results - investments can fall. Read the PDS. 
XYZ Super AFSL 123456."
```

##### Long-Form Content (60+ seconds)
```
EXTENDED FORMAT BENEFITS:
✓ Detailed product explanations
✓ Customer testimonials and case studies
✓ Educational content with product integration
✓ More comprehensive risk disclosure
✓ Multiple call-to-action opportunities

STRUCTURE FOR LONG-FORM:
0-10 seconds: Compelling hook
10-30 seconds: Problem/solution setup
30-60 seconds: Product benefits and features
60-80 seconds: Risk disclosure and disclaimers
80-90 seconds: Call to action and next steps
```
