# Telemarketing & Phone Guidelines

## ☎️ Phone-Specific Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Phone Channel Challenges
- **Real-time interaction**: Cannot control pace of information delivery
- **No visual aids**: All information must be conveyed verbally
- **Interruption marketing**: Calling during consumer's other activities
- **Legal restrictions**: Strict hawking prohibitions for most financial products

#### 📊 Consumer Context
- **Unwanted interruption**: Most financial product calls are prohibited
- **High skepticism**: Phone fraud awareness creates resistance
- **Limited attention**: Consumers multitasking or want to end call quickly
- **Compliance complexity**: Hard to deliver all required information verbally

### 🚫 Critical Legal Restrictions

#### Hawking Prohibitions
```
STRICTLY PROHIBITED:
❌ Unsolicited calls offering most financial products
❌ Cold calling for investments, insurance, credit products
❌ Door-to-door visits for credit products
❌ Unsolicited contact at home for financial products

EXCEPTIONS (Limited):
✅ Existing customer relationships
✅ Response to consumer inquiry
✅ Some deposit products by ADIs
✅ General business insurance (limited circumstances)
```

#### 🏦 ADI Deposit Products (Banks, Credit Unions)
- **Limited permission**: Can call about deposit accounts
- **Restrictions apply**: Cannot be "unsuitable" calls
- **Best practice**: Still obtain consent before calling
- **Clear identification**: Must identify as sales call

### ✅ Permitted Phone Marketing Activities

#### 📞 Inbound Call Handling
When consumers call you:
- **Full disclosure**: All information must be provided verbally
- **Script compliance**: Use approved scripts for consistency
- **Transfer protocols**: Clear handoff to licensed representatives
- **Follow-up rules**: What information can be sent after call

#### 📧 Response to Inquiries
Following up on consumer-initiated contact:
- **Timely response**: Within reasonable timeframe of inquiry
- **Scope limitation**: Stay within bounds of original inquiry
- **Additional products**: Cannot introduce unrelated products
- **Documentation**: Record inquiry source and scope

#### 🤝 Existing Customer Calls
Calling current customers:
- **Relationship basis**: Must have genuine existing relationship
- **Relevant products**: Should relate to current holdings
- **Opt-out respect**: Honor customer preferences
- **Regular review**: Ensure relationship remains current

### 📋 Script Development for Permitted Calls

#### 🎤 Essential Script Elements
```
CALL OPENING (First 30 seconds):
✓ Company name and licensing details
✓ Caller identification and role
✓ Purpose of call disclosure
✓ Permission to continue conversation
✓ Estimated call duration

EXAMPLE OPENING:
"Hello, this is [Name] from [Company], AFSL 123456. I'm calling about 
your recent inquiry regarding our investment products. Do you have 
5 minutes to discuss this, or would you prefer I call back at a 
better time?"
```

#### 💰 Investment Product Scripts
```
REQUIRED VERBAL DISCLOSURES:
✓ Past performance warnings (if discussed)
✓ Investment risk acknowledgment
✓ Fee structure overview
✓ PDS availability and importance
✓ Cooling-off period rights
✓ No pressure/time to consider

EXAMPLE DISCLOSURE:
"The returns I mentioned are past performance - they don't guarantee 
future results. Your investment value can go up or down, and you could 
lose money. There are fees involved which are detailed in our PDS. 
I'll send that to you, and please read it before making any decisions. 
There's no rush - you have time to think this over."
```

#### 🏠 Credit Product Scripts
```
VERBAL REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Interest rate and comparison rate
✓ Rate basis explanation (amount/term)
✓ Credit criteria application
✓ Assessment requirement
✓ Documentation needs
✓ Australian Credit Licence number

EXAMPLE SCRIPT:
"Our home loan rate is currently 4.5%, which is 4.8% comparison rate 
based on $150,000 over 25 years. That comparison rate includes the 
main fees. We'd need to assess your situation - credit criteria apply. 
I can arrange for someone to review your circumstances. [Company] 
Australian Credit Licence 789012."
```
