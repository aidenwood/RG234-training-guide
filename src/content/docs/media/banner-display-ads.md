# Banner & Display Ads Guidelines

## 🖼️ Display Advertising Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Display Ad Challenges
- **Limited space**: Must convey benefits, risks, and compliance in minimal real estate
- **Visual hierarchy**: Balancing attention-grabbing design with mandatory disclosures
- **Context targeting**: Appearing on various websites with different audience profiles
- **Banner blindness**: Users increasingly ignore traditional display advertising

#### 📊 Audience Context
- **Distracted browsing**: Ads compete with main website content for attention
- **Quick scanning**: Milliseconds to capture interest before users scroll past
- **Context influence**: Website content affects how ads are perceived
- **Device variety**: Desktop, mobile, tablet display differences

### ✅ Best Practices for Marketing Teams

#### 📏 Size-Specific Compliance Strategies

##### Large Format Banners (728x90, 300x250)
```
LEADERBOARD (728x90) APPROACH:
✓ Clear headline with main benefit
✓ Essential disclaimer in readable font
✓ Company branding with licensing
✓ Strong call-to-action button
✓ PDS reference where space permits

MEDIUM RECTANGLE (300x250) LAYOUT:
✓ Benefit statement (top third)
✓ Visual element (middle third)  
✓ Disclaimer and CTA (bottom third)
✓ Logo and licensing (integrated)
✓ High contrast for mobile viewing
```

##### Small Format Banners (320x50, 160x600)
```
MOBILE BANNER (320x50) STRATEGY:
✓ Single clear benefit statement
✓ Essential risk warning only
✓ Tap-to-expand for full details
✓ Company name minimum
✓ Landing page handles full compliance

SKYSCRAPER (160x600) APPROACH:
✓ Vertical information hierarchy
✓ Progressive disclosure design
✓ Scrollable content area
✓ Multiple touch points
✓ Bottom CTA with compliance link
```

#### 🎨 Visual Design Compliance

##### Text Hierarchy and Readability
```
TEXT STANDARDS:
✓ Minimum 10pt font for disclaimers
✓ High contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
✓ Sans-serif fonts for readability
✓ Bold for important warnings
✓ No decorative fonts for compliance text

VISUAL HIERARCHY RULES:
1. Headline/benefit (largest, boldest)
2. Key risk warning (prominent, clear)
3. Company branding (visible, consistent)
4. Call-to-action (action-oriented design)
5. Additional disclaimers (readable, not hidden)
```

##### Color and Contrast Strategy
```
COMPLIANCE-FRIENDLY COLORS:
✓ Dark text on light backgrounds for disclaimers
✓ Avoid red/green combinations (accessibility)
✓ Consistent brand colors throughout
✓ Warning text in neutral colors
✓ Call-to-action in contrasting colors

ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:
• WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 contrast)
• Color-blind friendly palettes
• No reliance on color alone for meaning
• Clear visual separation between elements
```

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Disclaimer Font Too Small
- **Problem**: Making legal text unreadable to save space
- **Solution**: Use expandable areas, progressive disclosure
- **Standard**: If disclaimer can't be read easily, redesign the ad

#### ❌ Misleading Visual Context
- **Problem**: Images that contradict or overshadow risk warnings
- **Solution**: Ensure visual elements support, not undermine, balanced messaging
- **Example**: Avoid celebration imagery while discussing investment risks

#### ❌ Inconsistent Landing Page Experience
- **Problem**: Ad promises not reflected on landing page
- **Solution**: Exact message matching, consistent disclaimer language
- **Process**: QA check every ad-to-landing-page journey
