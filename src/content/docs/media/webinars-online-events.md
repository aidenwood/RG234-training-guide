- **Interaction management**: Chat, polls, and Q&A compliance monitoring

#### 📊 Online Event Context

- **Convenience factor**: Attendees join from office or home
- **Recording sharing**: Content may be shared beyond original audience

Closing (5 mins): Summary, resources, next steps, contact information

COMPLIANCE INTEGRATION:
• Disclaimer slides at key points
• Verbal reinforcement of written disclaimers
• Balanced presentation of benefits and risks
• Clear educational vs. promotional distinction
• Professional advice recommendations
```

##### Interactive Element Management
```
INTERACTION COMPLIANCE:
✓ Chat moderation for inappropriate content

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Unmoderated Q&A Sessions
- **Problem**: Allowing inappropriate questions or advice-seeking
