# Radio Advertising Guidelines

## 🎙️ Radio-Specific Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Radio Challenges
- **Sequential information**: Cannot present disclaimers simultaneously with main message
- **No visual aids**: Must convey all information through audio only
- **Limited attention**: Listeners often multitasking (driving, working)
- **No replay option**: Information must be clear on first hearing

#### 📊 Audience Context
- **Drive time**: Peak listening during commutes (limited attention)
- **Background listening**: Often secondary activity
- **Demographic targeting**: Station-specific audience profiles
- **Local focus**: Strong community connection opportunities

### ✅ Best Practices for Marketing Teams

#### 🎤 Script Development
```
STRUCTURE: Opening Hook → Main Message → Risk Disclosure → Call to Action
TIMING: 30-second ads need ~7 seconds for disclaimers
PACE: Slow enough for comprehension, especially for disclaimers
TONE: Consistent throughout - don't undermine risks with upbeat delivery
```

#### 📝 Essential Script Elements
1. **Clear identification**: Company name and licensing details
2. **Balanced messaging**: Benefits followed by appropriate risk warnings
3. **Comprehensible disclaimers**: Read at normal conversational pace
4. **Contact information**: Clear phone numbers or websites
5. **Document references**: "Read the PDS before making decisions"

#### ⏱️ Timing Guidelines
| Ad Length | Content Allocation | Disclaimer Time |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 15 seconds | 8s message, 4s disclaimer, 3s contact | Minimum 4 seconds |
| 30 seconds | 18s message, 7s disclaimer, 5s contact | Minimum 7 seconds |
| 60 seconds | 40s message, 12s disclaimer, 8s contact | Minimum 12 seconds |

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Speed Reading Disclaimers
- **Problem**: Racing through legal requirements
- **Solution**: Allocate adequate time, use normal speaking pace
- **Test**: Have non-industry person listen and repeat back key points

#### ❌ Tonal Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Upbeat music continuing during risk warnings
- **Solution**: Adjust background music/effects for serious disclosures
- **Example**: Fade music during "Investment values can go down as well as up"

#### ❌ Incomplete Information
- **Problem**: Assuming listeners will seek additional details
- **Solution**: Include essential information in the ad itself
- **Remember**: Radio ad must stand alone as accurate communication

### 📋 Content Requirements by Product Type

#### 💰 Investment Products
```
MUST INCLUDE:
✓ Past performance warning (if performance mentioned)
✓ Risk of loss disclosure
✓ Fee information (if specific fees mentioned)
✓ PDS reference
✓ AFSL number

EXAMPLE SCRIPT:
"XYZ Super returned 8% last year. Past performance doesn't guarantee 
future results. Your investment value can fall as well as rise. 
Fees apply - read our PDS. XYZ Pty Ltd AFSL 123456."
```

#### 🏠 Credit Products
```
MUST INCLUDE:
✓ Comparison rate (if interest rate mentioned)
✓ Comparison rate warning
✓ Credit criteria apply
✓ Australian Credit Licence number

EXAMPLE SCRIPT:
"Home loans from 4.5% comparison rate 4.8%. Comparison rate based on 
$150,000 over 25 years. Credit criteria apply.

```

#### 🛡️ Insurance Products
```
MUST INCLUDE:
✓ Policy limitations/exclusions
✓ Premium factors (age, location, etc.)
✓ PDS reference

EXAMPLE SCRIPT:
"Car insurance from $400. Price depends on your age, location and 
driving history. Exclusions apply. Read our PDS for full terms."
```
