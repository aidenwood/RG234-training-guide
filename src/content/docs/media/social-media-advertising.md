# Social Media Advertising Guidelines

## 📱 Social Media-Specific Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Social Media Challenges
- **Character limitations**: Severe space constraints for comprehensive disclosure
- **Casual context**: Users expect informal content, not formal compliance language
- **Viral potential**: Content can be shared rapidly beyond intended audience
- **Platform algorithms**: Engagement-driven systems may not favor compliance-heavy content

#### 📊 Audience Context
- **Scroll behavior**: Users quickly scroll past content, limited attention spans
- **Social proof influence**: User comments and shares affect message perception
- **Mobile-first consumption**: Primarily accessed via mobile devices
- **Cross-generational**: Wide age ranges requiring different communication approaches

### ✅ Best Practices for Marketing Teams

#### 📱 Platform-Specific Strategies

##### Facebook Advertising
```
FACEBOOK AD REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Clear disclaimer in ad copy
✓ Compliant landing page link
✓ Appropriate audience targeting restrictions
✓ Community standards compliance
✓ Business verification for financial services

FACEBOOK AD EXAMPLE:
Headline: "Smart Super Growth Strategies"
Text: "ABC Super returned 8% last year. Past performance doesn't guarantee 
future results. Investment values can fall. Read PDS before deciding."
CTA: "Learn More"
Legal: "ABC Super AFSL 123456"
```

##### Instagram Advertising
```
INSTAGRAM CONSIDERATIONS:
✓ Visual-first compliance integration
✓ Story vs. feed different requirements
✓ Hashtag compliance implications
✓ Image disclaimer overlays
✓ Bio link compliance information

Text overlay: "Super growth opportunity*"
Bottom text: "*Past performance warning - see bio link"
Swipe up: Direct to compliant landing page
```

##### LinkedIn Professional Targeting
```
LINKEDIN B2B APPROACH:

```

##### TikTok and Emerging Platforms
```
TIKTOK CHALLENGES:
⚠️ Very young audience demographics

⚠️ Limited financial product suitability

WHEN APPROPRIATE:

```

#### 📝 Content Creation Strategies

##### Micro-Content Compliance
```
SHORT-FORM CONTENT APPROACH:
✓ Lead with key benefit
✓ Essential disclaimer only
✓ Direct to comprehensive information
✓ Use approved shortened phrases
✓ Maintain professional credibility

EXAMPLE TWEET (280 characters):
"Home loans from 4.5% (4.8% comparison rate based on $150k/25yr). 
Credit criteria apply. ABC Lending ACL 789012. Apply: [link]"
```

##### Visual Content Integration
```

✓ Platform-specific formatting

VISUAL DESIGN STANDARDS:

```

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Inappropriate Platform Choice
- **Problem**: Advertising complex products on youth-focused platforms
- **Solution**: Match product complexity to platform demographics
- **Consideration**: Some financial products unsuitable for certain platforms

- **Problem**: Not monitoring comments, shares, and user-created content
- **Solution**: Active community management, response protocols
- **Risk**: User comments may create misleading impressions

#### ❌ Inconsistent Cross-Platform Messaging
