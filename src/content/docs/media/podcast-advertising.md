# Podcast Advertising Guidelines

## 🎧 Podcast-Specific Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Podcast Challenges
- **Host-read ads**: Personal endorsement implications and credibility transfer
- **Long-form content**: Opportunity for detailed explanations but risk of information overload
- **Engaged audiences**: High listener attention but sophisticated, skeptical consumers
- **Niche targeting**: Specific audience segments with varying financial sophistication

#### 📊 Audience Context
- **Active listening**: Higher engagement than traditional radio
- **Subscription-based**: Audience chose specific content, expects relevance
- **Device flexibility**: Mobile, desktop, smart speakers - various attention levels
- **Binge consumption**: Multiple episodes consumed in sequence

### ✅ Best Practices for Marketing Teams

#### 🎤 Content Strategy by Format

##### Host-Read Advertisements
```
STRUCTURE: Personal Introduction → Product Benefits → Risk Disclosure → Personal CTA
TONE: Conversational but responsible - maintain host credibility
DISCLOSURE: "This is a paid partnership with [Company]"
AUTHENTICITY: Host should genuinely understand and believe in product
```

##### Produced Spot Ads
```
STRUCTURE: Hook → Benefits → Clear Disclaimers → Strong CTA
TIMING: 30-60 seconds typical, up to 90 seconds acceptable
PRODUCTION: Professional quality to match podcast standards
COMPLIANCE: Same requirements as radio but more time for detail
```

##### Sponsored Segments
```
INTEGRATION: Natural fit with podcast content themes
DISCLOSURE: Clear announcement of sponsorship relationship
EDUCATION: Opportunity for financial literacy alongside promotion
BALANCE: Educational content balanced with promotional messaging
```

#### 📝 Script Development Guidelines

##### Host-Read Scripts
- **Talking points format**: Bullet points rather than word-for-word scripts
- **Host personality**: Allow natural delivery while ensuring compliance
- **Key phrases**: Must-include compliance language clearly marked
- **Flexibility**: Room for host's natural conversation style

##### Example Host-Read Framework:
```
INTRO: "I want to talk about something that's helped me with [relevant topic]..."
TRANSITION: "My friends at [Company] have developed..."
BENEFITS: [Host's personal experience or understanding]
RISKS: "Now, like any investment, there are risks you need to know about..."
DISCLOSURE: "Full details in their PDS, and remember this is a paid partnership"
CTA: "Check them out at [website] - that's [spelling if needed]"
```

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Over-Relying on Host Credibility
- **Problem**: Assuming host endorsement replaces proper disclaimers
- **Solution**: Host credibility enhances but cannot replace compliance requirements
- **Remember**: Audience trust makes accurate information even more critical

#### ❌ Information Overload
- **Problem**: Using long format to include excessive technical detail
- **Solution**: Focus on key benefits and risks, direct to PDS for complexity
- **Balance**: Enough detail for informed decision without overwhelming

#### ❌ Inconsistent Messaging
- **Problem**: Different versions across multiple podcast placements
- **Solution**: Core compliance messages must be consistent across all versions
- **Flexibility**: Allow host personality while maintaining regulatory accuracy

### 📋 Content Requirements by Product Type

#### 💰 Investment Products
```
HOST-READ REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Past performance context (if mentioned)
✓ "Investments can go down as well as up"
✓ "Read the PDS before making any decisions"
✓ Company licensing information
✓ Clear sponsorship disclosure

EXAMPLE HOST DELIVERY:
"I've been learning about investing through [Company]. They showed me 
their fund returned 8% last year, but they were really clear that 
past performance doesn't guarantee future results - investments can 
go up and down. Before you do anything, read their PDS to understand 
all the risks and fees. This is a paid partnership with [Company], 
AFSL 123456."
```

#### 🏠 Credit Products
```
HOST-READ REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Comparison rate (if interest rate mentioned)
✓ Rate comparison explanation
✓ "Credit criteria apply" or similar
✓ Australian Credit Licence number

EXAMPLE HOST DELIVERY:
"I've been working with [Company] on my home loan. They're offering 
4.5% interest, which is 4.8% comparison rate. That comparison rate 
includes fees and is based on a $150,000 loan over 25 years. 
Of course, credit criteria apply - they need to assess your situation. 
[Company] ACL 789012, and this is a paid partnership."
```

#### 🛡️ Insurance Products
```
HOST-READ REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Policy limitations acknowledgment
✓ Premium variation factors
✓ PDS reference for full terms
✓ Claims process realism

EXAMPLE HOST DELIVERY:
"I got my car insurance sorted with [Company]. Mine's $400 but yours 
could be different - depends on your age, where you live, driving 
history, that sort of thing. There are exclusions too, so check their 
PDS for what's covered and what's not. This is a paid partnership 
with [Company]."
```
