# Direct Mail Guidelines

## 📬 Direct Mail Requirements for Marketing Teams

### ⚡ Key Marketing Considerations

#### 🎯 Unique Direct Mail Challenges
- **Physical permanence**: Mail pieces kept and shared
- **Privacy intrusion**: Unsolicited mail in personal space
- **Targeting precision**: Demographic and geographic specificity
- **Response attribution**: Direct tracking opportunities

#### 📊 Direct Mail Context
- **Home environment**: Reviewed in personal, family setting
- **Decision time**: Recipients can review at their own pace
- **Tangible credibility**: Physical mail implies established business
- **Cost implications**: Higher cost per contact requires efficiency

### ✅ Best Practices for Marketing Teams

#### 📮 Mail Format Strategy

##### Self-Mailer Formats
```
SELF-MAILER COMPLIANCE:
✓ Front panel hook with balanced messaging
✓ Interior space for detailed information
✓ Comprehensive disclaimers on main panels
✓ Clear company identification
✓ Contact information prominence

EXAMPLE INVESTMENT SELF-MAILER:
Front: "SUPER FUND PERFORMANCE UPDATE"
Inside left: Product benefits and features
Inside right: Risk warnings and disclaimers
Back: Contact information and call-to-action
```

##### Letter and Brochure Packages
```
PACKAGE COMPONENTS:
✓ Outer envelope (teaser copy compliance)
✓ Cover letter (personal tone, full disclosure)
✓ Brochure (comprehensive product information)
✓ Response device (application/inquiry form)
✓ Business reply envelope

LETTER STRUCTURE:

### 🚨 Common Marketing Mistakes

#### ❌ Misleading Envelope Copy
- **Problem**: Overpromising in teaser copy on outer envelope
- **Solution**: Ensure envelope claims match interior content
- **Compliance**: Envelope is part of advertising, must be accurate

#### ❌ Hidden Disclaimers
- **Problem**: Placing important warnings on back panels or fine print
- **Solution**: Integrate key risks into main content areas
- **Visibility**: Critical information must be easily found

Our ABC Balanced Super Fund delivered an 8% return last year, 
helping members build their retirement savings.

However, it's important to understand that past performance 
is not a reliable indicator of future performance. Investment 
values can rise and fall, and you may receive back less than 
you invested.

Before making any decisions, please read our Product Disclosure 
Statement which explains all fees, risks, and investment 
strategies in detail..."
