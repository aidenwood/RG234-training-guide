# Media-Specific Guidance

## 📻 Audio Advertisements (Radio, Podcasts)

### ✅ Best Practices
- **Clear speech**: Warnings and disclaimers read at comprehensible speed
- **Sequential information**: Important details can't be spoken simultaneously
- **Appropriate pacing**: Allow time for listeners to process key information
- **Clear distinction**: Between advertising and program content

### ⚠️ Challenges
- Cannot run warnings simultaneously with main message
- Listeners can't review or re-read information
- Temporary nature means lasting impressions must be accurate

### 📞 Telemarketing & On-Hold Messages
- Subject to same regulations as other advertising
- Must provide balanced information despite time constraints
- Cannot rely on follow-up calls to correct misleading impressions

## 📺 Film and Video Advertisements

### ✅ Best Practices
- **Visual clarity**: Risk information must be easily understood on first viewing
- **Appropriate timing**: Sufficient time to read and understand disclaimers
- **Clear presentation**: Not undermined by distracting sounds or images
- **Prominent warnings**: Despite visual and audio distractions

### 🎬 Distribution Considerations
- Applies to all video content regardless of platform
- YouTube, television, and other video platforms have same requirements
- Consider viewing conditions (device size, attention level)

## 🌐 Internet Advertising

### 💻 Website and Banner Ads
#### ✅ Best Practices
- **Standalone clarity**: Banner ads must be clear when viewed alone
- **Balanced information**: Can't rely on click-through for balance
- **Overall impression**: Consider first-time viewer perspective
- **Record keeping**: Ensure advertisements can be preserved

#### ⚠️ Limitations
- Content limitations don't excuse misleading advertisements
- Physical limitations of medium not a defense
- Third-party sites require extra caution (less motivation to click-through)

### 📱 Social Media and Microblogging
#### ✅ Platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- **Character limits**: Don't excuse misleading content
- **Overall impression**: Must be accurate when viewed alone
- **Appropriateness**: Consider if medium suitable for complex products
- **Platform context**: Consider high-trust environments

#### ⚠️ Special Considerations
- Consumers may not expect advertising in social contexts
- Viral nature means lasting impact beyond control
- Difficulty in maintaining records of social content

### 🔗 Interactive Content
- **Click-through limitations**: Additional information cannot cure misleading headlines
- **Progressive disclosure**: Must maintain accuracy at each level
- **User journey**: Consider various paths users might take

## 📰 Print Media (Newspapers, Magazines, Brochures)

### ✅ Best Practices
- **Visual hierarchy**: Important information must be prominent
- **Reading flow**: Arrange information logically
- **Adequate space**: For necessary warnings and disclaimers
- **Clear typography**: Ensure readability of all elements

### 🎨 Visual Design Considerations
- **Images and text**: Must work together, not contradict
- **Color and contrast**: Ensure important information stands out
- **Layout**: Don't hide important information in poor locations

## 🏢 Outdoor Advertising (Billboards, Transit)

### ✅ Best Practices
- **Viewing conditions**: Consider distance and movement
- **Simple messaging**: Complex information difficult to convey
- **Brand focus**: Better for recognition than detailed product information
- **Visibility**: Account for lighting, weather, viewing angles

### ⚠️ Limitations
- **Time constraints**: Brief viewing time limits information
- **Distance factors**: Text must be readable from intended viewing distance
- **Movement considerations**: Messages viewed from moving vehicles

### 🚌 Transit and Venue Advertising
- Consider audience attention levels
- Account for viewing environment (noise, distractions)
- Ensure messages are complete and balanced despite space constraints

## 📧 Direct Marketing

### 📬 Email and Direct Mail
#### ✅ Best Practices
- **Complete information**: Can include more detailed information

- **Personalization**: Ensure targeting is appropriate

### 📞 Telemarketing
- **Script compliance**: Ensure all spoken information is accurate
- **Time management**: Allow adequate time for disclosures
- **Record keeping**: Maintain records of what was communicated
- **Follow-up**: Cannot rely on later calls to correct misleading impressions

## 🎪 Events and Presentations

### 🎤 Seminars and Group Presentations
#### ✅ Best Practices
- **Audience appropriateness**: Match complexity to audience sophistication
- **Balanced presentation**: Include risks alongside benefits
- **Material consistency**: Slides and spoken content must align
- **Q&A management**: Ensure responses are accurate and balanced

### 📋 Handout Materials
- Must comply with all written advertisement requirements
- Cannot contradict verbal presentations
- Should supplement, not correct, verbal content

## 🔄 Cross-Platform Considerations

### 📊 Integrated Campaigns
- **Consistency**: All elements must tell same story
- **Medium limitations**: Cannot excuse misleading content in any channel
- **Sequential viewing**: Consider how audiences move between channels
- **Record keeping**: Maintain records across all platforms

### 🎯 Audience Overlap
- **Multiple touchpoints**: Reinforcement vs. contradiction risks
